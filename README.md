# Discord-ThanosBot
When I’m done, half of humanity will still exist. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. I hope they remember you.

## Requirements
The end is near.
* discord.py
* All 6 Infinity Stones
* The strongest will

## Installation
I ignored my destiny once, I cannot do that again. Even for you. I’m sorry little one.
* Install requirements
* Insert your Bot Token Stone in the gauntlet.py
* Run thanos.py

## Usage
You’re strong. But I could snap my fingers, and you’d all cease to exist. Type the following command to perfectly balance your Discord server.
```
!snap
```
Did you do it? Yes. What did it cost? Everything.

## Contributors
I know what it’s like to lose. To feel so desperately that you’re right, yet to fail nonetheless. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives. Or should I say, I have.

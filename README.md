# Discord-ThanosBot
When I’m done, half of humanity will still exist. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. I hope they remember you.

## Installation
* Install requirements from requirements.txt
* Rename 'config.example.py' to 'config.py'
* Insert your Bot Token in config.py
* Run thanos.py
* The end is near.

## Usage
You’re strong. But I could snap my fingers, and you’d all cease to exist.
Type the following command to perfectly balance your Discord server. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
```
!snap
```
You did it. What did it cost? Everything.

I know what it’s like to lose. To feel so desperately that you’re right, yet to fail nonetheless. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives. Or should I say, I have.
